## Skills to obtain
- AWS/Cloud
  - Cloud Computing has definetly caught my eye, and while I have done some introductory courses when it comes to AWS I want to further enhance my skills and look forward to getting a AWS certificate.
- C++
  - I have done some C++ at the start of my university degree but haven't touched it since. I would like to revist the language and a small project using it.
- Unity or Unreal
  - I'm a massive gamer, so learning how games are made would be really interesting!
- Blender
  - While my artistic skills with a pen and paper might be lacking I'd like to take a shot at 3D modelling and see what I can come up with. I'd also like to spiral into 3D printing potentially.
